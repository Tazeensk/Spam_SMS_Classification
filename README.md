# SMS Spam Detection Project

This project aims to detect spam SMS messages using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the SMSSpamCollection dataset for training and testing purposes.

## Overview

- The `sms_spam_detection.ipynb` notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- The dataset used for this project is `SMSSpamCollection (1)`.
- The project implements two classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- It also includes functionality to classify new messages as spam or ham.

## File Descriptions

- `sms_spam_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `SMSSpamCollection (1)`: Dataset file containing SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
- `readme.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all Python libraries required to run the code.

## Usage

1. Open and execute `sms_spam_detection.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Ensure all necessary libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt` are installed.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train models and classify messages.

## Reporting Spam

If you encounter a message suspected to be spam, you can report it using the provided functionality in the notebook. Simply run the code cell and follow the prompts.
